## About

This repo is a collection of models, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks that I experiment with as I learn more about machine learning. Some of the models and helper functions
found in here have been copied from other sources and in those cases I provide a link to the original work. My intention is to initially copy those models and tweak them
to better understand how they work and along the way create my own models.

My goal is to explore recent advancements in NLP/NLG, image recognition, world modeling, and reinforcement learning.

## Inspiration

Links to blogs and whitepapers I read and use as inspiration:
- [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/)
- [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf)
- [MMD Variational Autoencoders](https://ermongroup.github.io/blog/a-tutorial-on-mmd-variational-autoencoders/)
- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)

## Getting Started

- `pipenv shell && pip install`


## Datasets

Below is a collection of datasets I use when training these models.
